# HCAHPS Patient Survey Analysis using SQL and Tableau

## Overview

This repository contains the SQL scripts and serves as a reference for the analysis conducted on HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems) patient survey data. The project aims to analyze patient perspectives on hospital care, identify areas of strength and weakness, and provide insights that can contribute to improving the overall patient experience. SQL is used for data extraction, cleaning, and preparation, while Tableau is used to create interactive visualizations and dashboards.
